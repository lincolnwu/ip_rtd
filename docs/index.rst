ImmunoPheno: a data-driven platform for the design and analysis of immunophenotyping experiments
================================================================================================

ImmunoPheno is a data-driven bioinformatics platform designed to enhance the design and analysis of 
immunophenotyping experiments. This platform aims to overcome the limitations of current cytometry
techniques to allow researchers to more accurately and efficiently identify and annotate
cell populations in multiplexed antibody-based cytometry data. By leveraging single-cell
atlases technologies such as CITE-Seq, ImmunoPheno can improve the phenotypic resolution,
accuracy, and reproducibility of cell annotations in experiments.
